This was meant to be an upload manager for youtube creators. My plan was that it would be an automator-esque UI which would allow creators to create workflows for publishing videos.

I kinda sorta figured out how to use the Youtube API, and then promply lost interest. Maybe one day I'll come back to this.

PS: This was done in my sophmore year of highschool
